    ## TMF API Reference : TMF 632 - Party

    ### Release : 19.0

    The party API provides standardized mechanism for party management
    such as creation, update, retrieval and deletion. Party Individual
    has any kind of relation inside Fibre NetCo or InfCo.
    Party is created to record individual information.
    For example, within the context of a Creating non Connected Orders,
    Party API allows creation of the Customer as an individual for later use
    and processing. Consumer of that API should reference on an Individual with
    the ID of the Individual. This is the Key that Consumer has to store in their Model.
