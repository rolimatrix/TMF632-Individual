# TMF632-Individual
TMF632 Individual build with Flask

I created this Implementation only to extend my Developer Expertise.
Motivated from my Job as Lead Business Architect inside German Telecom IT, where i work as responsible for Giga.

One of my actual Task is to design TF632 Individual Solution in use for Giga. Not for Enterprise!!!
I reduced unneaded Schema and GET Methode for Endpoint Host/Individual/. See swagger in Folder /conf/swagger.

On 1.6.2021: Patch Method is not yet build.

I used Flask and Flassger. Flassger only to have Swagger UI available for that Flask APP. When App is runnig you can call  
http://host/apidocs (Example: http:://localhost:5000/apidocs) to study and try execution for documented endpoints.

....next time more documentation
